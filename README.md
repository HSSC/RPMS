Research Permissions Management System
======================================

The Research Permissions Management System (RPMS) is a novel and comprehensive mechanism for electronically capturing and managing research permissions, informed consents and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy authorizations for research. The RPMS project was undertaken in South Carolina with support from a Grand Opportunity grant (grant number RC2LM010796) from the National Library of Medicine to HSSC.
